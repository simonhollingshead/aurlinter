KNOWN UNFIXED BUGS:

- bzr+lp: URLs are considered invalid because the URL tester only runs over '://' containing URLs right now.
- Packages that use a revision from a VCS repo should not cause a message about not needing a pkgver().
- custom:CCPL is an invalid license, since the CCPL range is in common, but does not cause a warning message.
- Protocols other than those in the default DLAGENT get [!!!]
- Protocols such as `hib` get [!!!] messages for being unreachable, even though it's just because urlcheck doesn't know how to.
- If a PKGBUILD is in CRLF form, it does not get evaluated, when it should probably be converted and linted nonetheless.
- If a PKGBUILD lists no sources, the 'variable is empty' loop emits a [!  ] warning, then the validate step emits a [!!!] warning.


QUESTIONS:

Are there any things this tool cannot detect?

Yes.  If two of the same function are defined, one after the other, only the one as would be used during the makepkg process will actually be linted, and no messages of any kind will be emitted about the previous.

Why does my report say a package source is down?  It's up!  I can see it is!

In order to validate a URL, it is fetched multiple times over a day or two.  If it happens that the server suffers downtime exactly when the checks take place, it will be miscategorised.

What do messages like "Architecture not recognised.  (i686 x86_64)" or "Bad dependency.  ()" mean?

If you are providing an array of elements, each element is tested in turn.  In the first example, 'i686 x86_64' is not an architecture.  The fact this ever worked in makepkg was a bug due to missing quotation marks, and was corrected in pacman's git repository, commit b82a0d83, on Oct 31.  In the latter case, the issue is explictly stating a dependency on the empty string, rather than not making any dependencies.  Since no package has a package name of the empty string, this /technically/ cannot be resolved.

--

Why does my package show twice with the same errors, one as (i686) and once as (x86_64)?

If your PKGBUILD has any variables set specially based on the CARCH, then it goes through the report generator once per CARCH, otherwise one analysis phase called 'allarches' occurs.  There is no aggregation step if the issues in the package are identical regardless of CARCH.

--

I disowned or adopted a package, why isn't it listed as belonging to me?

The snapshot not only fetches the packages at that point in time, but associates the maintainer name, flagged/unflagged status and vote count at that point.  Changes made to PKGBUILDs, ownership, or changing the flag state on a package will not be recognised until the AUR packages are re-fetched.
